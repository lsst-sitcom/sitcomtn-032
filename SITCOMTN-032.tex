\section{Introduction}

The LSST defines exposures by the tuple \texttt{(instr, controller, dayObs, seqNum)},\footnote{
  Which are referred to as \texttt{(instr, controller, day\_obs, seq\_num)} in the butler
  (\eg \texttt{(AT, C, 2022-03-28, 666)}).}
When we take snaps (back-to-back exposures which will
be combined early in the DM processing), they are assigned sequential values of \texttt{seqNum}.

Rubin also has the concept of a \textit{visit}, which is used to express two distinct concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  These data maps to a point on the sky (as opposed to \eg a flat field exposure)
\item
  These data were taken as snaps, and the visit is the identifier for the combined data
\end{itemize}
While logically distinct, Jim Bosch and the middleware group prefers to use visit to mean
\textit{both} of these,
as it avoids repeated ``does this visit map to a region of the sky?'' tests.

\section{Changes Proposed in (DM) \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/RFC-836}{RFC-863}}

Most users of Rubin data will not care whether or not the data is taken using snaps, and
there are significant types of data taken on sky that are not taken as snaps; for example, intra-/extra-focal
pairs of images taken to analyze the state of the optics.

RFC-836 therefore proposes simplifying the current visit system:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  All exposures, whether consisting of snaps or not, may be referred to by their first
  \texttt{seqNum} without any need for the user to explicitly define a visit.
\item
  Visits must consist of exactly one or two snaps.
\item
  \texttt{groupId}s may not be used to define visits, but there will be selecting
  exposures identified by a \texttt{group\_id}, in much the same way that one can filter on an
  exposure type.  We expect that external tools will use this information to generate
  lists of exposures to be processed.
\end{itemize}

The restriction to one or two snaps allows us to simplify the
processing of snaps --- they are only used when the two snaps may be considered as part
of a single interrupted exposure. For \eg Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) where we may take tens
or even hundreds of exposures, each image is assigned a separate visit.

We anticipate that \texttt{groupId}s \textit{will} be used to define groups of \eg flat field
exposures that should be handled together, or a series of exposures taken in a DDF.  

\subsection{Metadata and the EFD}

The snaps within a visit are identified by 1-indexed keywords \texttt{CURINDEX} and \texttt{MAXINDEX},
which correspond to EFD names \texttt{imageIndex} and \texttt{imagesInSequence} respectively.

\subsection{Butler Access to Snaps}

Once this work is completed (expected to be \textit{c.} mid-April 2022) users will be able to use
\texttt{(day\_obs, seq\_num)} to refer to data whether it's a single exposure or a visit
(in which case \texttt{seq\_num} will be the first of the pair of snaps, if two snaps were taken), but
this means that we will need to add special syntax to access the first of the snaps (the second is easy,
as its \texttt{seq\_num} cannot be confused with a visit identifier), \eg
\texttt{(day\_obs, seq\_num, snap)} with \texttt{snap=1,2}.  The details are not yet decided.
